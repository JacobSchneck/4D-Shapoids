# Shapoids
2D, 3D and maybe even 4D, what shapes can I make!

## How to use

Run the make file (only supports linux command line and openGL/GLUT libraries for linux). \
Use z, x, c to rotate. 

## Goals

- Cycle between shapes with mouse click (complete)
- Rotate each shape (complete)
- Make a tetrahedron, cube and sphere. (complete)
- Make a tesseract, pentachoron and 4D-sphere (2 / 3 ain't bad)
- Optional: Add square, triangle and circle
- Optional: Refactor codebase into more organized folder system
